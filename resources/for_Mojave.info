The base system and apple diagnostics images being used are sourced from a particular release's installer.

If using this for another release, obtain the installer for that release from apple, and find the needed files by:

 1. Right click the "Install Mac OS" application. 
 2. Select "Show package contents" from the right-click menu.
 3. Copy the files needed from the installer's /Contents/SharedSupport directory.
 4. Paste them into the recovery_partition_installation/resources/ directory, replacing the existing files. (do not keep both)
 5. Update the .info file in the resources/ directory's name to reflect the source installer version, in case the solution is reshared.


* There is a slightly more involved way to obtain the same files with a smaller downloaded package. (The Mac OS Installation image is over 6GB, where is this is under 500MB)

Download from apple's website a copy of macOSUpd10.X.X.RecoveryHDUpdate.pkg closest to your version of MacOS
High Sierra:

Then run: pkgutil --expand <path to package> <path to expand>
Mount RecoveryHDMeta.dmg and copy the same files from it.
